          <p class="med-text">
            One of our client’s services was a private mural walking tour. However, due to a lack of resources, it was under-developed. The tour was only a small section on one page of the website, and there was only one permanent tour guide in charge of facilitating the tours as well as training other volunteer tour guides.

          <!-- // Section Header -->

          <p class="med-text">The 90-minute walking tour was not accessible to all audiences, and was overwhelming due to the length and amount of information provided. As the goal of our client was to foster the mural art community in the area, it was important that the murals be made more accessible. A bonus would be to leverage the year-round walking tour to increase attendance rates for the annual mural festival.</p>

          <p class="med-text">
            After doing a 3-day design sprint, we created three fleshed out initial proposals with the goal of providing a more accessible alternative to the walking tour to a wider audience. I was primarily responsible for “Mural Hunt”, an app that gamified the mural viewing experience to attract younger audiences and provided incentives to bridge the gap between the tour and the festival.

          <p class="med-text">
            We found an opportunity to engage with our client's goals through designing for  educational systems, since they aligned perfectly with the BC Ministry of Education goals for arts education in schools:
          </p>
          <p class="quote">
            “Pursue a lifelong interest in the arts and gain the confidence to create and contribute to the local/national/global art community as an individual and/or group.”
          </p>
          <p class="med-text" style="margin-top:1rem">
            This supported our client's long-term goal of increasing mural literacy and awareness in the city, while also building new relationships in the education sector.

          <p class="med-text">
            Conducting user tests with teachers and teacher candidates allowed us to gauge the feasibility and usefulness of our prototypes. Afterwards, we used affinity diagramming to organize the feedback based on priority, allowing us to manage our time efficiently to deliver a high quality prototype by our deadline.

          <p class="paragraph med-text">
            During user testing, teacher candidates reinforced that the copy in the kit should be more descriptive and conversational. I revised the copy to describe what teachers <em>could</em> do with the items rather than what they’re <em>intended</em> to do, to avoid telling teachers how to do their jobs.

            Initially, each spread had a light-hearted one-liner for a friendly, conversational tone. Though well-received, <strong>teachers were more interested in what benefits the kit could offer</strong>. As a result, I replaced the jokes with descriptions of the kit items, as well as value propositions for teachers.

          <p class="paragraph  med-text">
            I worked with one teammate to block out the information design of the cards using whiteboard wireframes. We considered various sets of icons and shapes to represent the difficulty level and duration of the activities. However, we received feedback from teachers that different students and classes have different skill levels.

            Because this project was a collaboration with a client, I was required to consider feasibility and cost more than in other hypothetical school projects. When selecting what the kit would contain, I looked up production costs in order to judge whether the benefits of including the item outweighed the potential cost for our client.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph  med-text">
            I also gained more knowledge and familiarity with designing in the education domain, as our target audience were teachers and students of grades 6 and 7 classrooms. I conducted research into the current BC curriculum requirements, as well as arts activities that helped students build fundamental skills such as social bonding, critical thinking, and learning through play.
