            We created three personas: the VMF tour guide, an art advocate, and a local art enthusiast. I focused primarily on developing the persona of the VMF tour guide, specifically the pains, behaviours, needs and goals. This helped guide us in creating content for our prototypes, by understanding the tour guide's (and by extension, the organization's) intentions in the stories they tell.

            Initially, each spread had a light-hearted one-liner for a friendly, conversational tone.

            Each page includes information about the mural and artist, as well as a photo to be inclusive of students who may not be able to visit the murals in person. Included in the kit are mural sticker sheets, which teachers may use as prizes for visiting the murals. This gamification aspect brings an element of joy to the experience and provides incentive to engage more meaningfully with the murals.

          <p class="paragraph small-text">
            During user testing, teachers appreciated the inclusion of photos for students who may not have the resources to visit the murals in person, and suggested including reflection questions as an alternative way to earn a prize stamp. This would also <strong>encourage students to practice their critical thinking</strong>, which was a major goal of the BC curriculum.

            We also received feedback the language used might be unfamiliar to students, especially English language learners. Rather than simplifying the language and losing the nuances of certain terms, we added a section with definitions and pronunciations. This provides students with a way to <strong>actively expand their vocabulary</strong>.

            Lesson activities were created after extensive research into the BC curriculum for Art for grades 6 and 7. The activities focused on encouraging students to develop a deeper interest in art, and build on skills such as critical thinking, teamwork, and self-reflection.

          <p class="paragraph small-text">
            I worked with one teammate to block out the information design of the cards using whiteboard wireframes. We considered various sets of icons and shapes to represent the difficulty level and duration of the activities. However, we received feedback from teachers that <strong>different students and classes have different skill levels</strong>.

          <p class="paragraph small-text">
            Each card has a border at the top, colour-coded to a “Big Idea”, taken straight from the BC curriculum. We did this in order to relate the ideas behind the lessons to teachers in terms they would already be familiar with. There are symbols for duration, so teachers can easily sort through the cards and scan for relevant information quickly.

            Because this project was a collaboration with a client, I was required to consider feasibility and cost more than in other hypothetical school projects. When selecting what the kit would contain, I looked up production costs in order to judge whether the benefits of including the item outweighed the potential cost for our client.

          <p class="paragraph small-text">
            I also gained more knowledge and familiarity with designing in the education domain, as our target audience were teachers and students of grades 6 and 7 classrooms. I conducted research into the current BC curriculum requirements, as well as arts activities that helped students build fundamental skills such as social bonding, critical thinking, and learning through play.
