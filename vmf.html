          <p class="paragraph">
            One of our client’s services was a private mural walking tour. However, due to lack of resources, it was under-developed in its current form. Initial observations found:
          </p>
          <ol class="list">
            <li>Information about the tour was only in a small section on one page of the website. </li>
            <li>There was only one permanent tour guide who was responsible for facilitating the tours and training other volunteer tour guides.</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="paragraph">Since this was one of their only year-round activities, there was both a need and an opportunity to leverage the tours to retain interest in the murals outside of the annual Mural Festival.</p>

          <!-- // Section Header -->

          <p class="paragraph additional-bottom-margin">My team went on a walking tour to get a first-hand experience of what the tours were like. We accompanied a group of tour attendees, which allowed us to observe their reactions as the tour unfolded. I took photos to document any pain points we noticed along the way, for analysis once we were back in the studio.</p>

            <li>Some murals were viewed at large distances, near streets with busy traffic, which made it difficult to hear. </li>
            <li>Murals set in alleyways meant that attendees had to stand in the middle of a road to view it.</li>
            <li>The walking tour moved as a group, so everyone had to keep the same pace.</li>

          <p class="paragraph">Using observations from our first-hand research, and information from client interviews and operations, we created a journey map and three personas to get a holistic view of the design problem and opportunities. I primarily worked on the stakeholder persona (tour guide), using information from our tour ethnography and client interviews.</p>

          <h3 class="paragraph-header">Key Frustrations</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">The 90-minute walking tour was not accessible to all audiences, and was overwhelming due to the length and amount of information provided. As the goal of our client was to foster the mural art community in the area, it was important that the murals be made more accessible. A bonus would be to leverage the year-round walking tour to increase attendance rates for the annual mural festival.</p>

          <h3 class="paragraph-header">Rapid Prototyping</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">
            After doing a 3-day design sprint, we created three fleshed out initial proposals with the goal of providing a more accessible alternative to the walking tour to a wider audience. I was primarily responsible for “Mural Hunt”, an app that gamified the mural viewing experience to attract younger audiences and provided incentives to bridge the gap between the tour and the festival.

          <h3 class="paragraph-header no-margin-top">Finding An Opportunity</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">We found an opportunity to engage with our client's goals through designing for  educational systems, since they aligned perfectly with the BC Ministry of Education goals for arts education in schools:</p>
          <p class="quote">“Pursue a lifelong interest in the arts and gain the confidence to create and contribute to the local/national/global art community as an individual and/or group.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">This supported our client's long-term goal of increasing mural literacy and awareness in the city, while also building new relationships in the education sector.</p>

          <h3 class="paragraph-header no-margin-top">User Testing</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">Conducting user tests with teachers and teacher candidates allowed us to gauge the feasibility and usefulness of our prototypes. Afterwards, we used affinity diagramming to organize the feedback based on priority, allowing us to manage our time efficiently to deliver a high quality prototype by our deadline.</p>

          <h3 class="paragraph-header">Supportive, Not Directive</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">During user testing, teacher candidates reinforced that the copy in the kit should be more descriptive and conversational. I revised the copy to describe what teachers <em>could</em> do with the items rather than what they’re <em>intended</em> to do, to avoid telling teachers how to do their jobs.</p>

          <img src="img/vmf/instruction2.png" alt="Instructions booklet kit overview" style="width:100%">

          <p class="paragraph">Initially, each spread had a light-hearted one-liner for a friendly, conversational tone. Though well-received, <strong>teachers were more interested in what benefits the kit could offer</strong>. As a result, I replaced the jokes with descriptions of the kit items, as well as value propositions for teachers.</p>

          <h3 class="paragraph-header">Balancing Fun With Educational</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">Our initial prototype had a large stamp area for students to prove they went to the murals, by receiving a stamp from nearby stores. However, this interaction was impractical, as store hours may not align with mural visits and large numbers of visitors may interfere with store operations.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Based on suggestions with teachers, we replaced the large stamp area with discussion questions instead. This encourages students to practice their critical thinking, which was a major goal of the BC curriculum.</p>

          <!-- // Section Header -->

          <p class="paragraph">Because this project was a collaboration with a client, I was required to consider feasibility and cost more than in other hypothetical school projects. When selecting what the kit would contain, I looked up production costs in order to judge whether the benefits of including the item outweighed the potential cost for our client.</p>
