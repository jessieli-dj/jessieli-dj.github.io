            After speaking with stakeholders and doing first-hand research into our client's services, we identified two opportunities: mural wall acquisition and private walking tours. We created journey frameworks for both of our opportunities in order to identify specific pain points.

            Because this project was a collaboration with a client, I was required to consider feasibility and cost more than in other hypothetical school projects. When selecting what the kit would contain, I looked up production costs in order to judge whether the benefits of including the item outweighed the potential cost for our client.

            I also gained more knowledge and familiarity with designing in the education domain, as our target audience were teachers and students of grades 6 and 7 classrooms. I conducted research into the current BC curriculum requirements, as well as arts activities that helped students build fundamental skills such as social bonding, critical thinking, and learning through play.
