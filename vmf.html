            From our research, we identified two opportunities: mural wall acquisition and private walking tours. We created journey frameworks for both of our opportunities in order to identify specific pain points.

            We created three personas: the VMF tour guide, an art advocate, and a local art enthusiast. I focused primarily on developing the persona of the VMF tour guide, specifically the pains, behaviours, needs and goals. This helped guide us in creating content for our prototypes, by understanding the tour guide's (and by extension, the organization's) intentions in the stories they tell.

            My team ran a 3-day condensed <a href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/" class="intext-link">design sprint</a> to rapidly ideate and prototype, using our framing question and detailed user journey framework to guide us in our ideating.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph small-text">
            The outcome of our sprint were three fleshed out mobile app concept proposals:
          </p>

          <ul class="paragraph small-text">
            <li><strong>Mural Hunt</strong> - A mobile app that asks players to visit murals to receive prizes for redemption at the annual festival.</li>
            <li><strong>Mural Bot</strong> - An AI chatbot leveraging Facebook Messenger to talk to users as they go on a self-guided tour.</li>
            <li><strong>Coming Soon</strong> - A series of physical art installations to give the local community a preview of murals that are coming soon.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="paragraph small-text">
            I was primarily responsible for <strong>Mural Hunt</strong>. I proposed combining gaming with viewing the murals, to engage younger audiences
            with mural art in a fun way. The idea was a mobile app that would send an alert and a time limited mission to complete if the player was near a mural. The player would earn prizes that could be redeemed at the annual mural festival. <strong>This would increase active engagement with the murals and provide incentive to attend the festival</strong>.

            Some concerns were discoverability and if someone from outside both Mount Pleasant and the mural art community would go there just to play the game. In addition, players with limited mobility may struggle with
            completing the task within the time limit.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph small-text">
            I worked with one teammate to refine the idea and create the user
            interface. <strong>To address discoverability, we specified our target audience to be people who were already in Mount Pleasant</strong>. Checkpoints would be placed throughout the area to invite people nearby to download the app to begin playing. Players would receive a list of murals at each checkpoint and earn stamps by doing activities at each mural. <strong>We also removed the time limit to allow players to move at their own pace</strong>.

          <p class="paragraph small-text">
            We presented our concept proposals to our client during a co-creation workshop for their feedback. I worked with one teammate to plan 4 activities for the workshop to help generate more ideas and specific designs directly with our client. We took inspiration from <a href="http://www.designkit.org/" class="intext-link">IDEO's design kit</a> and <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/planning-a-participatory-workshop" class="intext-link">JISC's Planning a Participatory Workshop</a>. We adapted each activity to fit our smaller group of participants, as well as to fit within our time constraint of 2 hours for the workshop.

          <p class="paragraph small-text">
             I was primarily responsible for the 2 ideating activities. For the first activity, I ensured that it was not too narrowed in scope, as we wanted to give the client freedom to come up with ideas beyond those we had presented already. Because the second ideating activity was to lead into a design/visualization activity, I designed it to be more structured and targeted than the first.

            These activities helped us uncover more of our client's long-term goals and values, including <strong>promoting mural literacy across Vancouver</strong>. Mural literacy is the ability to engage with, interpret and understand the differences between murals, street art, graffiti and vandalism.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph small-text">
            We found an opportunity to do this through outreach into BC arts education in the form of mural-themed kits for classroom teachers and students.

            The information booklet contains a kit overview with value proposition for teachers, detailed instructions on the supplies inside the kit, as well as an introduction to the featured artist of the kit. Each page of the booklet includes an image of each item in the kit and a brief description of how they are meant to be used.

          <p class="paragraph small-text">
            The copy in the booklet was written with a friendly, conversational tone in order to make the kit feel more welcoming for teachers of all ages and comfort levels with art lessons.

          <p class="paragraph small-text">
            I began with whiteboard wireframes to block out the layout of the information and how the instructions would be presented. Since it was for an art kit, I wanted to be more creative with it so I planned to have an accordian fold. However, I realized this would be <strong>impractical for quick referencing</strong>, so I scrapped that idea.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph small-text">
            During our user testing with teacher candidates, they reinforced that the copywriting should be <strong>more descriptive and conversational</strong>. In the final design, I changed the copy to describe what teachers <em>could</em> do with the items rather than what they’re <em>intended</em> to do, to avoid creating limitations for teachers.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph small-text">
            In the first iteration, each spread had a light-hearted one-liner to give a friendly, conversational tone. However, though it was well-received, this was replaced with more detailed descriptions of the kit items, as well as a kit overview with value proposition for teachers. These were changes made after user testing because <strong>teachers wanted to know up front what benefits the kit could offer</strong>.

            Each page in the passport includes information about the mural and artist, as well as a photo to be inclusive of students who may not be able to visit the murals in person. Included in the kit are mural sticker sheets, which teachers may use as prizes for visiting the murals. This gamification aspect brings an element of joy to the experience and provides incentive to engage more meaningfully with the murals.

            During user testing, there was a suggestion to add reflection questions as an alternative to visiting the murals physically, as some students may not have the resources to do so. This would also <strong>encourage students to practice their critical thinking</strong>, which was a major goal of the BC curriculum. In the final design, we created reflection questions for each mural that would provoke reflection from students about the themes of the murals.

          <p class="paragraph small-text">
            We also received feedback the language used might be unfamiliar to students, especially ELL students. Rather than simplifying the language and losing the nuances of certain terms, we added a section at the back with definitions and pronunciations. This provides students with a way to <strong>actively expand their vocabulary</strong>.

            Each card has a border at the top, colour-coded to a “Big Idea”, taken straight from the BC curriculum. We did this in order to relate the ideas behind the lessons to teachers in terms they would already be familiar with. There are symbols for duration, so teachers can easily sort through the cards and scan for relevant information quickly.

            I worked with one teammate to block out the information design of the cards using whiteboard wireframes. We considered various sets of icons and shapes to represent the difficulty level and duration of the activities. However, we received feedback from user testing that <strong>a difficulty rating system would be impractical, as different students and classes have different skill levels</strong>. As a result, we removed the difficulty ratings.

            Because this project was a collaboration with a client, I was required to consider feasibility and cost more than in other hypothetical school projects. When selecting what the kit would contain, I looked up production costs in order to judge whether the benefits of including the item outweighed the potential cost for our client.

            I also gained more knowledge and familiarity with designing in the education domain, as our target audience were teachers and students of grades 6 and 7 classrooms. I conducted research into the current BC curriculum requirements, as well as arts activities that helped students build fundamental skills such as social bonding, critical thinking, and learning through play.
