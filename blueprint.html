            In the United States, trades workers outnumber knowledge workers by 253%. However, only 11.5% of LinkedIn members work in the trades industries.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph small-text">
            With automation increasingly replacing jobs in trades industries, we found <strong>an opening for LinkedIn to diversity its userbase by providing support for trades workers</strong> interested in switching to a more future-proof career.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph small-text">
            In comparison to job searching sites like Indeed or Glassdoor which rely on aggregating job postings, <strong>LinkedIn's strength is its unique professional networking format</strong>. Our user interviews revealed that trades workers are commonly hired through referrals from family, friends and colleagues. This made LinkedIn the optimal platform to engage with these workers.

            When creating our persona, we were aware of the limitations of our solution and realized that it was unlikely we could design a digital intervention to immediately help someone who had just been laid off from their job. However, we did see the <strong>potential to support individuals who were pro-actively searching for opportunities to shift into a more stable career</strong>, and we aimed to target these individuals early on in their searching.

          <h4 class="subtitle">Why Mobile?</h4>

          <p class="paragraph small-text">
            Our first iteration of our solution was for desktop. However, research showed that individuals in manual labour occupations were more likely to use mobile devices to search for jobs, because their jobs require them to be on their feet and moving around rather than sitting behind a desk (<a href="http://blog.indeed.com/2017/07/27/the-unstoppable-rise-of-mobile-job-search/" class="intext-link">source</a>).
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph small-text">
            As a result, we chose to create our app for mobile-first.
          </p>

          <h4 class="subtitle">Mentor Profile + Timeline</h4>

          <p class="paragraph small-text">
            I adapted our original desktop profile and timeline screens for mobile. I created sketch wireframes of the mobile interfaces as well as how the user might interact with the elements and move through the page. Because there was so much information on the timeline, I introduced an element of horizontal scrolling to break up the amount of scrolling down.

          <p class="paragraph small-text">
            While iterating on the form of the smart chat, I sketched out multiple wireframes for the interface, as well as the content. Initially, I considered putting tasks inside the pop-up prompts, relating to the topic. However, this had the risk of disrupting the conversation as a potential distraction. In the end, we decided to keep the information contained to the chat window.

            I used Adobe After Effects to create our solution user flow. I began by disassembling the screens in Figma in order to export each interactive or moving part individually.

          <h4 class="subtitle">Branding</h4>
          <p class="paragraph small-text top-margin">
            To ensure that our video was consistent with LinkedIn's other product offering videos, I looked at LinkedIn's Youtube channel for inspiration. This can be seen in the use of their signature blue colour for the background, and the shortened, white logo instead of using the full logotype.
          </p>

          <h4 class="subtitle">Voiceover</h4>
          <p class="paragraph small-text top-margin">
            I wrote the script for the voiceover, and used a Zoom H4N recorder along with a shotgun mike to direct and record in a sound studio with our voice actor. After uploading the audio files, I used the audio mixer in Premiere Pro to boost the sound quality.
          </p>

          <h4 class="subtitle">Music</h4>
          <p class="paragraph small-text top-margin">
            We wanted to position our solution as a glimmer of hope for individuals who don't know how to move forward from their declining industry. As a result, I took care to select music that would match this tone; not too upbeat and cheerful, but also not too sombre. Furthermore, it should not be too complex-sounding with many highs and lows, as that could be a distraction from the content.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph small-text top-margin">
            In the end, I chose <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lbbHQbZNKg" class="intext-link">Lights by Sappheiros</a> because of its optimistic, yet low-key sound. Because the rhythmn is a repeating beat, it easily fades into the background.

            This project was my first time creating UI animations and micro-interactions. I realized the importance of keeping all the assets organized in both the prototyping program as well as After Effects, which made it much easier to edit and iterate on the go without wasting time locating resources. I was also able to develop my technical skills in After Effects.

          <p class="paragraph small-text">
            There were both benefits and downsides to sticking strictly with our client's branding and interface patterns. The benefit was becoming familiar with operating with established branding guidelines for consistency, which would be the most realistic scenario in an established company. The downside was that we had less freedom to explore visual design in this project.
