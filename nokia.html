            The IP/MPLS Simulation web app is a sandbox that network engineers can use to import a version of their IP network, play around with network configurations and simulate what-if scenarios.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">I designed the <strong>Worst Case Failure Scenarios</strong> tool for IP/MPLS Simulation, which allows engineers to choose any number of objects in their network and generate scenarios to see the consequences of that object failing.</p>

Since networks can include up to thousands of objects, <strong>simulating and analyzing failure scenarios one at a time is extremely time consuming and creates a large margin for human error.</strong></p>

I recorded requirements from the meeting to keep me on the project road map as I began my design explorations.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Since the scenarios could take hours to generate, I considered the experience from the user’s perspective to identify pain points that needed to be addressed, and in what order of priority. The most critical pain point was any outcome where the user would have to run the scenarios all over again, possibly due to lost or corrupt data.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">I maintained close communication with our team’s domain experts to learn what data our domain expert user needed and why. Knowing that different users may have different requirements, my goal was not to give them the “right” answer. My goal was to make the data accessible so they can easily find what they need when they need it.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">After reviewing the initial design with the team and incorporating their feedback, I produced interaction flow charts with detailed specs.

          <h3 class="paragraph-header">Reflection</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">A major challenge was putting myself into the user’s shoes. As a design student, I was as far away from our intended user as you could get. For me, an interface full of technical jargon would be overwhelming and confusing. For our user, it might be just right. I continuously improved my understanding of the domain by corresponding with domain experts on my team.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">The more I learned, the more I began to empathize with our user, allowing me to strike a balance of designing for general usability versus the specialized needs of our extremely technical expert user.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">This experience gave me the confidence to know that no matter what domain I step into next, I have the problem-solving and troubleshootings skills necessary to adapt and empathize.</p>
