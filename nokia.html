            <p class="paragraph">Network engineers must create contingencies in the event of network failure to avoid causing cause disruptions to internet service for customers. Since networks can include up to thousands of objects, <strong>simulating and analyzing failure scenarios one at a time is extremely time consuming and creates a large margin for human error.</strong> This is where our product, IP/MPLS Simulation, came in.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">
            The IP/MPLS Simulation web app is a sandbox that network engineers can use to import a version of their network, play around with configurations and simulate what-if scenarios to guide contingencies and optimizations.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">I designed the <strong>Worst Case Failure Scenarios</strong> tool for IP/MPLS Simulation, which allows engineers to choose any number of objects in their network and generate scenarios to see the consequences of that object failing.</p>

            <h2 class="paragraph-header">Preliminary Explorations</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">I started by facilitating a meeting with the developers, QA, and product manager, to align everyone on the general functionality. I recorded requirements from the meeting to keep me on the project road map as I began my design explorations.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Breaking down the flow into three chunks allowed me to understand the user’s perspective and thoughts at different stages of the process. I presented a preliminary navigation chart to the product team, which kept the team informed about my progress and generated discussion. This resulted in feedback that helped direct my next round of iterating.</p>

            <h3 class="paragraph-header">How might we make the waiting stage simple and painless?</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Since the scenarios could take hours to generate, I considered the experience from the user’s perspective to identify pain points that needed to be addressed, and in what order of priority. The most critical pain point was any outcome where the user would have to run the scenarios all over again, possibly due to lost or corrupt data.</p>
            <div class="spacer-mini-horizontal"></div>
            <h3 class="half-paragraph-header">Solution</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">A GUI-blocking dialog prevents user actions that might cause inaccuracy or loss of data, and provides assurance to users about the progress of the scenarios.</p>

          <h3 class="paragraph-header">How might we take a large amount of data and make it accessible?</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">I maintained close communication with our team’s domain experts to learn what data our domain expert user needed and why. Knowing that different users may have different requirements, my goal was not to give them the “right” answer. My goal was to make the data accessible so they can easily find what they need when they need it.</p>
          <div class="spacer-mini-horizontal"></div>
          <h3 class="half-paragraph-header">Solution</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">The large amount of data is broken up into two levels: a big picture view sorted by most critical to least critical scenarios, and a detailed view for advanced troubleshooting.</p>

            <h2 class="paragraph-header">Evolving design and documentation</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">After reviewing the initial design with the team and incorporating their feedback, I produced interaction flow charts with detailed specs. These documents were constantly evolving as the product team moved from one iteration to the next. As project road markers moved or changed, I updated these documents to provide a single source of truth for the product team.</p>

          <h2 class="paragraph-header">Reflection</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">A major challenge was putting myself into the user’s shoes. As a design student, I was as far away from our intended user as you could get. For me, an interface full of technical jargon would be overwhelming and confusing. For our user, it might be just right. I continuously improved my understanding of the domain by corresponding with domain experts on my team.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">The more I learned, the more I began to empathize with our user, allowing me to strike a balance of designing for general usability versus the specialized needs of our extremely technical expert user.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">This experience gave me the confidence to know that no matter what domain I step into next, I have the problem-solving and troubleshootings skills necessary to adapt and empathize.</p>
