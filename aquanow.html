                <p class="paragraph">When I was hired, customers were conducting crypto trades through the companyâ€™s web trading portal. However, they were often on-the-go and could not easily access the portal. <b>This resulted in the operations team being overloaded with simple requests</b> such as balance checking, basic trades, and deposits/withdrawals.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">I was tasked with gathering the customer requirements from the operations team, identifying the customerâ€™s needs, and delivering a comprehensive design for the mobile version of the web portal. </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                  As I was new to cryptocurrency, I started by conducting a heuristic and competitive analysis on four popular cryptocurrency mobile apps to get myself up to speed. </p>
                  
                 <p>This led to <b>two positive outcomes</b>. I identified industry standards and best practices that would drive my design decisions and got buy-in from stakeholders. Secondly, it acted as a crash course for me on the design space so that I could begin to speak the same language as the team, increasing my credibility.</p>

                <h2 class="paragraph-header">Understanding the Customer</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">I received feature requirements from the operations team but before diving in, I took a step back to confirm we were tackling the right issue. I conducted a user journey mapping exercise, consulting with subject matter experts for accuracy. Emphasizing the customer's perspective, we validated that features were addressing specific pain points, boosting confidence in our solution.</p>

              <h2 class="paragraph-header">Architecting an App</h2>
              <p class="paragraph">I collaborated closely with the mobile developer, delivering iterative design work. In the early stages, I used sitemaps and wireflows to share concepts quickly, iterating based on feedback. Once high-level flows were approved, the developer started work, allowing me to focus on detailed interactions.</p>

              <h2 class="paragraph-header">Design and Design Again</h2>
              <p class="paragraph">As I explored concepts, one feature that went through many rounds of iteration was the market view, the most important view in the app. It was the first page that customers would see and it showed the prices for coins.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">There were many different elements of the page that competed in importance and so the ultimate goal was to find the right balance. I listened closely to our subject expertsâ€™ feedback, while also referring to the competitors that I studied at the start and providing a user-focused perspective. Happily, we came to a final design that satisfied everyoneâ€™s concerns.</p>

            <h2 class="paragraph-header">Web to Mobile</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">My prior mobile design experience proved invaluable, especially as the team was predominantly versed in web design. I was transparent about design rationale, emphasizing changes needed to convert UI from web to mobile. This fostered mobile design fluency among the team, resulting in more targeted feedback and enhanced UX overall.</p>

          <p class="paragraph"> I was at the end of a 3 month contract but the quality of my work and attitude on the project had impressed the CTO. I was offered a full-time position as the lead UX designer, taking ownership of Aquanowâ€™s full suite of web applications to make them enterprise-ready. </p>
          <p class="paragraph">Over my time at Aquanow, I worked on a multitude of projects for 4 web apps and 1 mobile app. I created the Aquanow design system which was used for customer-facing UIs. I spearheaded initiatives to do usability research with internal users for our internal apps and had the opportunity to hire and mentor a junior co-op student. I learned a whole lot from my experience here and if youâ€™ve made it all the way to the end of my story, Iâ€™d love to chat with you more in an interview. </p>
