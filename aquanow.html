                <p class="paragraph">
                  As I was new to the cryptocurrency space, my first action was to do a competitive analysis to get myself up to speed. I ran a heuristic and competitive analysis on four popular cryptocurrency mobile apps, which I then shared with stakeholders.
                  
                  This led to <b>two positive outcomes</b>. I identified industry standards and best practices that would drive my design decisions and got buy-in from stakeholders. Secondly, it acted as a crash course for me on the design space so that I could begin to speak the same language as the team, increasing my credibility.

            <h2 class="paragraph-header">Preliminary Explorations</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">The first thing I did was facilitate a meeting with the developers, QA, and product manager, to start everyone on the same page about the general functionality. I recorded requirements from the meeting to keep me on the project road map as I began my design explorations.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Breaking down the flow into three chunks allowed me to understand the user’s perspective and thoughts at different stages of the process.</p>

            <h3 class="paragraph-header">How might we make the waiting stage simple and painless?</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Since the scenarios could take hours to generate, I considered the experience from the user’s perspective to identify pain points that needed to be addressed, and in what order of priority. The most critical pain point was any outcome where the user would have to run the scenarios all over again, possibly due to lost or corrupt data.</p>

            <h3 class="half-paragraph-header">Solution</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">A GUI-blocking dialog prevents user actions that might cause inaccuracy or loss of data, and provides assurance to users about the progress of the scenarios.</p>

          <h3 class="paragraph-header">How might we take a large amount of data and make it accessible?</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">I maintained close communication with our team’s domain experts to learn what data our domain expert user needed and why. Knowing that different users may have different requirements, my goal was not to give them the “right” answer. My goal was to make the data accessible so they can easily find what they need when they need it.</p>

          <h3 class="half-paragraph-header">Solution</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">The large amount of data is broken up into two levels: a big picture view sorted by most critical to least critical scenarios, and a detailed view for advanced troubleshooting.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">After reviewing the initial design with the team and incorporating their feedback, I produced interaction flow charts with detailed specs. These documents were constantly evolving as the product team moved from one iteration to the next. As project road markers moved or changed, I updated these documents to provide a single source of truth for the product team.</p>

          <h2 class="paragraph-header">Reflection</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">A major challenge was putting myself into the user’s shoes. As a design student, I was as far away from our intended user as you could get. For me, an interface full of technical jargon would be overwhelming and confusing. For our user, it might be just right. I continuously improved my understanding of the domain by corresponding with domain experts on my team.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">The more I learned, the more I began to empathize with our user, allowing me to strike a balance of designing for general usability versus the specialized needs of our extremely technical expert user.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">This experience gave me the confidence to know that no matter what domain I step into next, I have the problem-solving and troubleshootings skills necessary to adapt and empathize.</p>
