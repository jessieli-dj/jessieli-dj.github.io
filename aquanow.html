                <h2 class="paragraph-header">The Mobile App</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">When I was hired, customers were conducting crypto trades through the company’s web trading portal. However, they were often on-the-go and could not easily access the portal. <b>This resulted in the operations team being overloaded with simple requests</b> such as balance checking, basic trades, and deposits/withdrawals.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">I was tasked with gathering the customer requirements from the operations team, identifying the customer’s needs, and delivering a comprehensive design for the mobile version of the web portal. </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                  As I was new to cryptocurrency, I started by conducting a heuristic and competitive analysis on four popular cryptocurrency mobile apps to get myself up to speed. </p>
                  
                 <p>This led to <b>two positive outcomes</b>. I identified industry standards and best practices that would drive my design decisions and got buy-in from stakeholders. Secondly, it acted as a crash course for me on the design space so that I could begin to speak the same language as the team, increasing my credibility.</p>

                <h2 class="paragraph-header">Understanding the Customer</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">I received feature requirements from the operations team but before diving in, I took a step back to confirm we were tackling the right issue. I conducted a user journey mapping exercise, consulting with subject matter experts for accuracy. Emphasizing the customer's perspective, we validated that features were addressing specific pain points, boosting confidence in our solution.</p>

              <h2 class="paragraph-header">Architecting an App</h2>
              <p class="paragraph">I collaborated closely with the mobile developer, delivering iterative design work. In the early stages, I used sitemaps and wireflows to share concepts quickly, iterating based on feedback. Once high-level flows were approved, the developer started work, allowing me to focus on detailed interactions.</p>

              <h2 class="paragraph-header">Design and Design Again</h2>
              <p class="paragraph">As I explored concepts, one feature that went through many rounds of iteration was the market view, the most important view in the app. It was the first page that customers would see and it showed the prices for coins.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">There were many different elements of the page that competed in importance and so the ultimate goal was to find the right balance. I listened closely to our subject experts’ feedback, while also referring to the competitors that I studied at the start and providing a user-focused perspective. Happily, we came to a final design that satisfied everyone’s concerns.</p>

      <section class="narrow-section">
        <h2 class="paragraph-header">Coin Filter</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">My initial design included coin type filters as there could be many. However, stakeholders felt that it was too hidden. One business objective was to expose the amount of coins we supported, which could increase trade as customers usually traded in a few specific coins. I revised the design with that in mind. The choice chips acted as tabs, displaying a few chips by default and the user could scroll to discover more. This allowed us to address the most common use cases while also supporting edge cases. </p>

    <section class="narrow-section">
      <h2 class="paragraph-header">Market Pricing and Actions</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">My first proposal was to have minimal information on the Market screen and click into a specific coin to see the pricing and action buttons. However, stakeholders felt this was a level of interaction that might cause user drop-off before actually placing an order. On their advice, I explored options of exposing the price and call-to-actions earlier in the flow.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The final design we landed on was a nice compromise. Users could see the price and go directly to placing an order from the Market screen but only once they have expanded the coin they’re interested in. This avoided overwhelming the user with too much information as soon as they opened the app while still speeding up their workflow. </p>

            <h2 class="paragraph-header">Web to Mobile</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">My prior mobile design experience proved invaluable, especially as the team was predominantly versed in web design. I was transparent about design rationale, emphasizing changes needed to convert UI from web to mobile. This fostered mobile design fluency among the team, resulting in more targeted feedback and enhanced UX overall.</p>

          <p class="paragraph"> I was at the end of a 3 month contract but the quality of my work and attitude on the project had impressed the CTO. I was offered a full-time position as the lead UX designer, taking ownership of Aquanow’s full suite of web applications to make them enterprise-ready. </p>
          <p class="paragraph">Over my time at Aquanow, I worked on a multitude of projects for 4 web apps and 1 mobile app. I created the Aquanow design system which was used for customer-facing UIs. I spearheaded initiatives to do usability research with internal users for our internal apps and had the opportunity to hire and mentor a junior co-op student. I learned a whole lot from my experience here and if you’ve made it all the way to the end of my story, I’d love to chat with you more in an interview. </p>
