          <p class="project-intro">I designed the Aquanow mobile app, which saved time for the operations support team by converting a crypto-trading platform
            from web to mobile, allowing customers to self-serve basic trading and wallet management.</p>

          <h2 class="paragraph-header">The Problem</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">The only option for self-serve crypto trades were through the company’s web
            trading portal. However, customers were often on-the-go and could not easily access the portal. <b>This resulted in the operations team being overloaded with simple requests</b> such as balance checking, basic trades,
            and deposits/withdrawals.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">I was tasked with gathering the customer requirements from the operations team,
            identifying the customer’s needs, and delivering a comprehensive design for the mobile version of the web
            portal. </p>

          <p class="paragraph">
            As I was new to cryptocurrency, I conducted a competitive analysis on four popular
            cryptocurrency mobile apps to get myself up to speed and identify industry standards and best practices that
            would drive my design decisions and got buy-in from stakeholders. </p>

              <p class="paragraph"><strong>Progressive Information Disclosure</strong></p>
              <p class="paragraph">Screen space on mobile is limited in comaprison to web, meaning we need to balance
                the information density on each page. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex-onethird">
              <p class="paragraph"><strong>Remove the Fluff, Get to the Prices</strong></p>
              <p class="paragraph">Prices were displayed prominently on the dashboard, meaning you could begin thinking about trades right away with minimal barriers like setting up your wallet until
             users were ready to trade. </p>

            <div class="flex-onethird">

        <p class="paragraph">I received feature requirements from the operations team but before diving in, I took a
          step back to confirm we were tackling the right issue. I conducted a user journey mapping exercise, consulting
          with subject matter experts for accuracy. Emphasizing the customer's perspective, we validated that features
          were addressing specific pain points, boosting confidence in our solution.</p>

          prices
          for coins.There were many different elements of the page that competed in importance so it was critical to find the right balance to increase the chances of converting users from browsing to completing a trade. I listened closely to our subject experts’ feedback, while also referring
          to the
          competitors that I studied at the start and providing a user-focused perspective. We came to a final
          design
          that satisfied everyone’s concerns.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">My prior mobile design experience proved invaluable, especially as the team was
            predominantly versed in web design. I was transparent about design rationale, emphasizing changes needed to
            convert UI from web to mobile. This fostered mobile design fluency among the team, resulting in more
            targeted feedback and enhanced UX overall.</p>

          <div class="spacer-horizontal"></div>
          <p class="paragraph"> I was at the end of a 3 month contract but the quality of my work and attitude on the
            project had impressed the CTO. I was offered a full-time position as the lead UX designer, taking ownership
            of Aquanow’s full suite of web applications to make them enterprise-ready. </p>
          <p class="paragraph">Over my time at Aquanow, I worked on a multitude of projects for 4 web apps and 1 mobile
            app. I created the Aquanow design system which was used for customer-facing UIs. I spearheaded initiatives
            to do usability research with internal users for our internal apps and had the opportunity to hire and
            mentor a junior co-op student. I learned a whole lot from my experience here and if you’ve made it all the
            way to the end of my story, I’d love to chat with you more in an interview. </p>
