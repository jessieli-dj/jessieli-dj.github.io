          <h2 class="paragraph-header">The Problem</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">When I was hired, customers were conducting crypto trades through the company’s web
            trading portal. However, they were often on-the-go and could not easily access the portal. <b>This resulted
              in the operations team being overloaded with simple requests</b> such as balance checking, basic trades,
            and deposits/withdrawals.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">I was tasked with gathering the customer requirements from the operations team,
            identifying the customer’s needs, and delivering a comprehensive design for the mobile version of the web
            portal. </p>

          <p class="paragraph">
            As I was new to cryptocurrency, I started by conducting a heuristic and competitive analysis on four popular
            cryptocurrency mobile apps to get myself up to speed and identify industry standards and best practices that
            would drive my design decisions and got buy-in from stakeholders. </p>

              <p class="paragraph">Screen space on mobile is limited in comaprison to web, meaning we need to balance
                the information density on each page. The best way to do this is to hide information until the user
                needs it.</p>

            <div class="flex-onethird">
              <p class="paragraph"><strong>02 / Remove the Fluff, Get to the Prices</strong></p>
              <p class="paragraph">Prices were displayed prominently on the dashboard, meaning you could begin thinking
                about trades right away. In many apps, you didn't need to deposit money or set wallet addresses until
                you were ready to trade. </p>

                after digging deeper is the user exposed to detailed trading charts with changes over time.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">I received feature requirements from the operations team but before diving in, I took a
          step back to confirm we were tackling the right issue. I conducted a user journey mapping exercise, consulting
          with subject matter experts for accuracy. Emphasizing the customer's perspective, we validated that features
          were addressing specific pain points, boosting confidence in our solution.</p>

        <h2 class="paragraph-header">Architecting an App</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">I collaborated closely with the mobile developer, delivering iterative design work. In
          the early stages, I used sitemaps and wireflows to share concepts quickly, iterating based on feedback. Once
          high-level flows were approved, the developer started work, allowing me to focus on detailed interactions.

        <h2 class="paragraph-header">Design and Design Again</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">As I explored concepts, one feature that went through many rounds of iteration was the
          market
          view, the most important view in the app. It was the first page that customers would see and it showed the
          prices
          for coins.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">There were many different elements of the page that competed in importance and so the
          ultimate
          goal was to find the right balance. I listened closely to our subject experts’ feedback, while also referring
          to the
          competitors that I studied at the start and providing a user-focused perspective. Happily, we came to a final
          design
          that satisfied everyone’s concerns.</p>

          <h2 class="paragraph-header">Web to Mobile</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">My prior mobile design experience proved invaluable, especially as the team was
            predominantly versed in web design. I was transparent about design rationale, emphasizing changes needed to
            convert UI from web to mobile. This fostered mobile design fluency among the team, resulting in more
            targeted feedback and enhanced UX overall.</p>

          <div class="spacer-horizontal"></div>
          <p class="paragraph"> I was at the end of a 3 month contract but the quality of my work and attitude on the
            project had impressed the CTO. I was offered a full-time position as the lead UX designer, taking ownership
            of Aquanow’s full suite of web applications to make them enterprise-ready. </p>
          <p class="paragraph">Over my time at Aquanow, I worked on a multitude of projects for 4 web apps and 1 mobile
            app. I created the Aquanow design system which was used for customer-facing UIs. I spearheaded initiatives
            to do usability research with internal users for our internal apps and had the opportunity to hire and
            mentor a junior co-op student. I learned a whole lot from my experience here and if you’ve made it all the
            way to the end of my story, I’d love to chat with you more in an interview. </p>
