        <h2 class="paragraph-header">Problem Statement</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">One of our client’s services was a private mural walking tour. However, due to lack of resources, it was under-developed in its current form. Initial observations found:</p>
        <ol class="list">
          <li>Information about the tour was only in a small section on one page of the website. </li>
          <li>There was only one permanent tour guide who was responsible for facilitating the tours and training other volunteer tour guides.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="paragraph">Since this was one of their only year-round activities, there was both a need and an opportunity to leverage the tours to retain interest in the murals outside of the annual Mural Festival.</p>

          <h2 class="paragraph-header no-margin-top">Ethnographic Research</h2>
          <p class="paragraph additional-bottom-margin">My team went on a walking tour to get a first-hand experience of what the tours were like. We accompanied a group of tour attendees, which allowed us to observe their reactions as the tour unfolded. I took photos to document any pain points we noticed along the way, for analysis once we were back in the studio.</p>

            <li>Some murals were viewed at large distances, near streets with busy traffic, which made it difficult to hear. </li>
            <li>Murals set in alleyways meant that attendees had to stand in the middle of a road to view it.</li>
            <li>The walking tour moved as a group, so everyone had to keep the same pace.</li>

          <p class="paragraph">Using observations from our first-hand research, and information from client interviews and operations, we created a journey map and three personas to get a holistic view of the design problem and opportunities. I primarily worked on the stakeholder persona (tour guide), using information from our tour ethnography and client interviews.</p>

        <h2 class="paragraph-header">Key Frustrations</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">The 90-minute walking tour was not accessible to all audiences, and was overwhelming due to the length and amount of information provided. As the goal of our client was to foster the mural art community in the area, it was important that the murals be made more accessible. A bonus would be to leverage the year-round walking tour to increase attendance rates for the annual mural festival.</p>

          <h2 class="paragraph-header">Rapid Prototyping</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">After doing a 3-day design sprint, we created three fleshed out initial proposals with the goal of providing a more accessible alternative to the walking tour to a wider audience. I worked on “Mural Hunt”, an app that gamified the mural viewing experience to attract younger audiences and provided incentives like redeemable prizes to bridge the gap between the tour and the festival.</p>

        <h2 class="paragraph-header">Finding An Opportunity</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">We found an opportunity to engage with our client's goals through designing for  educational systems, since they aligned perfectly with the BC Ministry of Education goals for arts education in schools:</p>
        <p class="quote">“Pursue a lifelong interest in the arts and gain the confidence to create and contribute to the local/national/global art community as an individual and/or group.”</p>
        <p class="paragraph">This supported our client's long-term goal of increasing mural literacy and awareness in the city, while also building new relationships in the education sector.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">A mural-inspired art lesson kit for BC grades 6 and 7 classrooms, including art lesson planning cards for teachers, mural passports for students, and mural stickers. Each kit comes with an instructions booklet introducing the kit items in a friendly and supportive tone. </p>

          <p class="paragraph">Conducting user tests with teachers and teacher candidates allowed us to gauge the feasibility and usefulness of our prototypes.

          <h2 class="paragraph-header">Supportive, Not Directive</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">A key point brought up in user testing was an emphasis that the copy in the kit should be descriptive and conversational rather than directive, giving teachers more flexibility in adapting the lessons to their class's specific needs. Additionally, though our friendly one-liners on each spread was well-received, teachers were more interested in what benefits the kit could offer. </p>

          <h2 class="paragraph-header">Balancing Fun With Educational</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">Our initial prototype had a large stamp area for students to prove they went to the murals by receiving a stamp from nearby stores. This interaction was impractical for two reasons: store hours may not align with mural visits and large numbers of visitors may interfere with store operations. We replaced the large stamp area with discussion questions to encourage critical thinking, which was a major goal of the BC curriculum.</p>

          <h2 class="paragraph-header">Familiar Language</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">Art lesson activity cards were included to support teachers who may not necessarily have an arts background. Each lesson card has a border at the top, colour-coded to a “Big Idea” written at the top of each card, allowing for easy sorting. The "Big Idea" and "Curricular Competencies" copy is taken straight from the BC curriculum in order to relate the ideas behind the lessons to teachers in terms they would already be familiar with.</p>

        <h2 class="paragraph-header">Reflection</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">This was a heavily research-driven project, as our brief was to find a client and identify an opportunity to improve their operations through interaction design and user research. I learned about both user research and co-design methods, and how to extract actionable insights from these activities. This was a key experience that has influenced my current research-driven approach to design.</p>
