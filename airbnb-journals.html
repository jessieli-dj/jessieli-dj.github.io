          <p class="paragraph">
            For some demographics, such as people with disabilities and seniors, household chores can be an incredible burden. However, they <strong>may not have the money to hire a professional and/or feel hesitant about inviting a stranger into their home.</strong>

          <h3 class="paragraph-header">Proposal</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">HelpMate is a community-based task finding application that allows you to help their community members with household chores. The app provides an easy way for young people to connect with their communities while simultaneously earning some money or volunteer hours to put towards their education.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">HelpMate bridges the gap between Craigslist and TaskRabbit, aimed at the older high school demographic to provide help for individuals who may not be able to do household chores, focusing on social reputation rather than formal processes.</p>

            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Working through complex user flows</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">With two types of users (people posting a job and people looking for a job), it was key to understand both of their unique needs to understand what kind of features would be required in our app. For example, Joy (our client) wants to make sure that the Helper will get along with her parents when she's not there. On the other hand, Jordan needs flexible hours since he's a full-time student. In both cases, they want to make sure they're working with someone who's reliable and trustworthy. </p>

            <p class="paragraph">I facilitated a whiteboarding session as we worked through a typical user flow through our app, which allowed us to narrow down our MVP right away and got us thinking about key interface screens early on. This made it easier for us to diverge and re-converge when it came to ideating, and we were able to refer back to our shelved ideas later in our process once we had our MVP down.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">After many iterations, we had a version of our app that we were happy with. Naturally, it was time to take it to our users and see where we went right and where we went wrong. We got a lot of great feedback, which we organized and addressed by priority levels: major, minor, and opportunities.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">HelpMate is a verified service that allows both Helpers and Clients to see each other’s profiles and ratings. This ensures that both parties are aware of the other’s behaviours and instills a sense of assurance for the completion of a task.</p>

          <h3 class="paragraph-header">Find The Right Job</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">Originally, our home screen was just a list of tasks but we quickly realized that this was too dry and it was a lot of scrolling. So we added in a map, with the caveat that information like addresses had to be "blurred out" until the client and helper were actually ready to accept the job. We combined our map and list view, chunking up the information and giving the user a couple of different ways they could use to search for the right job.</p>

            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Community</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">We believe there’s more to the relationship than monetary exchange. HelpMate encourages building personal relationships, not just hiring someone to get the job done. As such, one of the main interactions in our app is the chat function, which users are encouraged to use for everything from requesting a job to rescheduling and/or cancelling.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Sometimes, clients are busy and might not be able to be present during a task. For their peace of mind, they can choose to receive live updates when the Helper is completing the task. </p>

          <div class="content-box">
            <p class="paragraph">HelpMate’s scheduling flexibility allows Helpers and Clients to organize an task without the rigidity of a formal job. Safeguards are in place in event of cancellation and rescheduling. Clients can feel assured their job will still be completed, while Helpers can cancel worry-free in the event of an emergency.</p>

            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Reflection</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">Designing an app with two distinct types of users was difficult at first, because it meant having to think through every single piece of functionality and interaction from two very different perspectives. When the users' goals aligned, it was smooth sailing. Yet other times, they were in direct conflict. It was certainly an exercise in learning to prioritize and assess the relative consequences versus benefits of prioritizing one thing as opposed to anther. </p>
            <p class="paragraph">This was an incredibly extensive project, and there's tons of details I wasn't even able to cover in this case study so if you're interested, I welcome you to get in touch! </p>
