          <p class="paragraph">
            TumblerShare was a primarily paper-based system. Members trade their membership cards in to receive a tumbler at the coffee shop, and return the tumbler to get their membership card back. Sitting down with stakeholders revealed several insights to me about short-term and long-term goals for digitizing the program operations.

        <p class="paragraph">How are existing member using the program? Why aren’t there more people signing up? How could we help them want to become a TumblerShare member? <strong>A survey conducted with 16 members and 41 non-members shed some light on these questions:</strong></p>
        <ol class="list">
          <li>When respondents decide where to buy their coffee, the eco-friendliness of a store was not a major factor compared to location and price. </li>
          <li>When floated the idea of an app that would allow them to sign up online and expand the program to more locations, respondents expressed interest due to the convenience. </li>
          <li>Rewards and points systems were highly valued by members, showing that we needed to keep and highlight TumblerShare’s existing reward system.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="paragraph">“Convenient” was the key word here that I adopted as a primary design principle for the student experience, as it seemed like a major risk factor for app abandonment. </p>

          <p class="paragraph">Once we had established our target user, our problem statement, and our goal, it was time to start visualizing what our user flow might look like. Whiteboard wireframing allowed another designer and myself to quickly visualize rough estimations of our interactions and features before splitting up to create higher fidelity wireframes. </p>
          <p class="paragraph">Moving into gray box wireframes, I created many versions of screens to quickly test out different interactions and layouts, before selecting the most promising version for user testing.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">We conducted multiple rounds of user testing to validate our decisions as we went, using both greybox wireframes and the first version of our mockups. I facilitated the user testing sessions, asking participants to take us through a few common user flows in the app and observing their ease of use. While there were no major concerns in terms of usability and findability, I did notice that reactions from test participants to the information on the home screen ranged from interest to confusion to apathy.</p>

        <div class="spacer-small-horizontal"></div>


        <p class="half-paragraph content-box"> To reduce unnecessary information overload and visual distraction, I simplified the home screen to the MVP: borrowing and refilling tumblers. The current design of the home screen includes a clear, single call to action, combined with a single QR code modal that ensures speed to avoid holding up the line at busy coffee shops. The home screen also reflects the current status of the user's membership, so I created the designs for each of these different states while considering what information the user needed at each stage. </p>

          <p class="paragraph">I worked closely with the app developer to understand and refine my designs based on the technical limitations and constraints. Researching common UX patterns and applying them to our use case scenarios allowed me to create usage and visual specification guidelines which articulated design details clearly to minimize confusion when handing off designs. </p>

          <p class="half-paragraph">Members can see their individual contribution to reducing cup waste on the website, thus promoting continued engagement with the program. When creating the design, I simultaneously visualized how it would look on mobile to ensure that it would be user-friendly and intuitive for both web and mobile. This wasn't always easy since there were times where important information needed to be conveyed to the user (ex: if their membership had been suspended). I</p>

        <p class="paragraph">With all of our product team members being students in school or on co-op, it was important to manage our production timeline well to meet our deadlines. <strong>I took initiative to create and manage a Jira board with our tasks, using it as an organization tool to facilitate product review meetings.</strong> This improved transparency and accountability across the team, and ensured important tasks did not fall through the cracks.</p>

        <h2 class="paragraph-header no-margin-top">Reflection</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">As my first experience designing and shipping an entire app, there was a lot of trial and error involved. I was eager to create the perfect app for our user's needs but I learned quickly that shipping an app is very different than theoretical design exercises. There were so many more players involved, from stakeholders to marketing to development. These experiences taught me a lot about pivoting quickly, not getting attached to the "final" design, and working within technical limitations.</p>
