            <p class="paragraph">
              TumblerShare was a primarily paper-based system. Members trade their membership cards in to receive a tumbler at the coffee shop, and return the tumbler to get their membership card back. Sitting down with stakeholders revealed several insights to me about short-term and long-term goals for digitizing the program operations.

          <h2 class="paragraph-header no-margin-top">Preliminary Research</h3>

          <p class="paragraph">How are existing member using the program? Why aren’t there more people signing up? How could we help them want to become a TumblerShare member? <strong>A survey conducted with 16 members and 41 non-members shed some light on these questions:</strong></p>
          <ol class="list">
            <li>When respondents decide where to buy their coffee, the eco-friendliness of a store was not a major factor compared to location and price. </li>
            <li>When floated the idea of an app that would allow them to sign up online and expand the program to more locations, respondents expressed interest due to the convenience. </li>
            <li>Rewards and points systems were highly valued by members, showing that we needed to keep and highlight TumblerShare’s existing reward system.</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="paragraph">“Convenient” was the key word here that I adopted as a primary design principle for the student experience, as it seemed like a major risk factor for app abandonment. </strong></p>

            <p class="paragraph">Once we had established our target user, our problem statement, and our goal, it was time to start visualizing what our user flow might look like. Whiteboard wireframing allowed another designer and myself to quickly visualize rough estimations of our interactions and features before splitting up to create higher fidelity wireframes. </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Moving into gray box wireframes, I created many versions of screens to quickly test out different interactions and layouts, before selecting the most promising version for user testing.</p>
