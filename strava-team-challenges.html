          <p class="paragraph">Strava is a social network that brings people closer by sharing activities. However, the activities and challenges are individual, with social involvement only after you share a post. In this feature we leveraged Challenges to explore how the social aspect can be integrated more fully throughout the before and during stages of exercising.</p>

            <h2 class="paragraph-header">Users</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">The app experience is freeform, with little guided exercises, which made it not ideal for beginner athletes. Additionally, the emphasis on social features and community events meant that the app would be most appropriate for athletes of casual to intermediate skill level, rather than pro athletes. With this in mind, we formed our persona as a semi-experienced social runner. </p>

          <div class="content-box">
            <p class="paragraph">Because we were on a time crunch, I fleshed out the interactions as much as I could while sketching the wireflows, so that we could save time when translating the sketches later into mockups. Checking in with my teammates regularly allowed us to stay on the same page about the visualization of our idea, and I was able to pivot quickly and make adjustments on the go.</p>

            <h2 class="paragraph-header">Finding a Team</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">We placed team challenges on the same page as individual challenges so users can naturally discover the new feature as they use the app. At a glance, simple icons help identify what kind of athletes are required for each challenge. When inviting a teammate, users are shown a targeted list of friends and club members who have experience in that sport, so it's as easy as one tap to add a teammate.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Once a user has joined a team challenge, a Teams tab appears under their Feed where they can easily see at a glance both their own progress and their team's progress in a simple and clean interface. This also provides a place for members of a team to socialize and share content with each other, a necessity for a subset of users who may only be acquainted on the platform. </p>

            <p class="paragraph">We wanted to create a way for teammates to encourage each other even while exercising separately. When conceptualizing the form of the cheers, our priority was making sure that it wasn't overly intrusive, as we didn't want to distract athletes from their surroundings as this could be dangerous (eg. runners crossing the street). </p>

          <h2 class="paragraph-header">Considerations for Implementation</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">Though we weren't actually required to implement our design, we designed with implementation in mind. Components of the design are easily scaled and modified based on desired user experience: types of activities in challenge, number of team members, cheers UI, etc. And because we leveraged mostly existing interaction and UI patterns, this require less resources such as manpower and cost to create the feature.</p>

          <h2 class="paragraph-header">Reflection</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">
            With only three weeks to learn an entire app and create a concept for a feature that could plausibly live in it, time was definitely a challenge. I did my part by facilitating an app teardown to start the project, meticulously going through every page and possible userflow. In just one workshop, we were able to gain a comprehensive understanding of the app's interface, navigation, and interaction patterns. This really helped us move forward quickly, giving us more time to spend on brainstorming and iterating.
