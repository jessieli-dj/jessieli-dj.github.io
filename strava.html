          <h3 class="paragraph-header">Project Brief / App Teardown</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Tasked with creating a new feature for the Strava exercise app in three weeks, I worked with two other designers to conduct an intensive teardown of the app's existing features and interactions. This allowed us to quickly become familiar with the app's interface and interaction patterns, as well as their target audience.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">As a social network for athletes, based on its core feature of recording exercise routes on a map, Strava's primary target audience are runners and cyclists. The emphasis on social features (events, friends feed) shows the app is focused on athletes of casual to intermediate skill level rather than professionals.</p>

          <h3 class="paragraph-header">User Research Themes</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">Using a mix of user interviews and reading exercise forums, we were able to get a better sense of our target demographic's approach to exercising:</p>
          <ol class="list">
            <li>Some athletes are motivated by knowing and seeing other people participating in the same activities, and through social feedback such as likes and comment on their activities. </li>
            <li>Many athletes want to keep track of their personal progress. Some share their progress with their friends to receive social motivation, while others track it for personal motivation.</li>
            <li>Beginner and intermediate athletes find it difficult to find reputable information about gear. When looking through multiple forums about running and Strava, we found that many people were talking about gear online and asking for recomendations. </li>

            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Personas</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">We also did some research into Strava in order to understand the company's mission and motivations, which helped us put ourselves into the shoes of the company and understand what features might make sense from their position. Using this info and the user research info, we crafted two user personas (one target, one anti-persona) and one stakeholder persona. I worked on target and stakeholder personas, seen below.</p>

            <p class="paragraph"><strong>We moved forward with Team Challenges</strong> for two main reasons: one, it was the feature that aligned the most with the company's goals of creating a robust social network for athletes and two, our other proposals (including Gear Check) potentially leaned too far into the realm of e-commerce, which would stray from the app's core purpose.</p>

          <h3 class="paragraph-header">Considerations for Implementation</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">Though we weren't actually required to implement our design, we designed with implementation in mind. Components of the design are easily scaled and modified based on desired user experience: types of activities in challenge, number of team members, cheers UI, etc. And because we leveraged mostly existing interaction and UI patterns, this require less resources such as manpower and cost to create the feature.</p>
